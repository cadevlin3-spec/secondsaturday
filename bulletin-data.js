/* =====================================================================
   SECOND SATURDAY — MONTHLY BULLETIN
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   THIS IS THE ONLY FILE YOU NEED TO EDIT EACH MONTH.

   The website automatically shows the NEXT upcoming night as the big
   featured card, and lists the ones after it as "upcoming."
   Past dates disappear on their own.

   HOW TO EDIT:
   1. Change the text inside the "quotes".
   2. Keep the date in the format  "YYYY-MM-DD"  (year-month-day).
   3. Keep every comma and curly brace exactly where they are.
   4. Save the file, then commit/push (or edit it right on GitHub.com).

   You can leave any field as an empty "" and it just won't show.
